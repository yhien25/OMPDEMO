	OMP Philippines endeavors to be a family-safe website. To ensure this, we ask everyone to observe our rules and follow our guidelines.

	OMP Philippines, as a community-based system, aims for a "self-moderated" community where members are encouraged to moderate their own posts 
	and also allowed to help others moderate theirs. This way, it will be easier to manage a continually growing community. The members manage the
	community and administrators. Any member is encouraged to report anything they believe is a violation of these rules and policies.

	Your use of OMP Philippines is voluntary. We encourage, but do not require, you to become a member of the site. When you access or use our services 
	or sign up for a membership, you agree to abide by all our rules and policies (including any amendments, revisions, additions), which you affirm to
	have read and understood. Necessarily, this includes these Terms and Conditions, Responsibilities of all Users and Members, Content Guidelines,
	Posting ClassifiedGuidelines, OLX Gold Credits Terms and Conditions, and all other policies found in our Policies Page.

	We assume that you are an adult and have the legal capacity to enter into valid contracts. As a policy,
	we do not market our services to minors. 
	When we learn that a minor has provided us personal information, we delete the account and all the minor’s
	personal information from our system. However, this
	deletion does not cover information collected in the course of the minor’s use of our services and does not 
	guarantee that the information provided by a minor was not used prior to the deletion.
